## Author
Garrett Kegel

## Description
The team profile generator uses node.js and
the inquirer package to prompt a user with
questions about their team. The team consists
of a manager, an engineer, and an intern.
There can only be one manager, but the user
can enter in as manay engineers and interns
as necessary for their team composition.
The team is then written to an html file
and the html file displays each team member
as a card with the inputs obtained from the
user prompt answers.
  

  
## Installation
First, clone the repository to your local
machine. Then use npm i to install the 
necessary packages from the package.json file. 

## Usage
The application will ask a sequence of questions
and the answers to the questions will be used
to generate an html webpage. Open this webpage, 
which will be located in the 
team-profile-generator folder.
